📊 Customer Churn Prediction System
A comprehensive Machine Learning-powered web application that predicts customer churn probability using advanced ML algorithms and an intuitive web interface.
🎯 Overview
This system analyzes customer data across multiple dimensions—demographics, usage patterns, subscription details, service history, and engagement metrics—to predict the likelihood of customer churn. Built with Scikit-Learn and Streamlit, it provides real-time predictions with probability scores to help businesses proactively retain customers.
✨ Key Features

API Integration (Optional)
pythonimport requests
import json

url = "http://localhost:8501/predict"
data = {
    "age": 35,
    "tenure": 12,
    "monthly_charges": 89.99,
    # ... other features
}

response = requests.post(url, json=data)
prediction = response.json()
print(f"Churn Probability: {prediction['probability']}")
📈 Model Training
To retrain the model with new data:
bashpython train_model.py --data data/new_training_data.csv --output model.pkl
Training parameters can be customized in train_model.py:

Train-test split ratio
Hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, etc.)
Cross-validation folds
